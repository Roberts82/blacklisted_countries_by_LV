# blacklisted_countries_by_LV

he purpose of this project is to analyse the consequences of policy decisions of blacklisting countries for tax purposes. 

In my Masters Thesis (project https://github.com/Roberts82/Masters_Th_LU_BVEF) where I analysed the effects of double tax treaties on FDI to Latvia, being on the blacklist was used as one of control variables, and no significant effect on FDI to Latvia from a blacklisted country was found. It seems contraintuitive as the purpose of blacklisting is to limit economic cooperation widh the blacklisted countries (usually "blacklisting" happen when a jurisdiction does not cooperate in tax matters (for example does not provide informatation needed to assess tax in the residency country)). Moreover, "blacklisting" makes cooperation width companies from "blacklisted" countries more difficult, as widthholding taxes needed to be paid when dealing width such companies, as well as administrative burden increases. 
In this project I plan to analyse deeper the consequences of blacklisting of a countries on economic cooperation width the blacklisted countries width Latvia. I plan start width descriptive statistics and then analyse effects of blacklisting on publicly available data that can be used as nexus to estimate economic cooperation of Latvian companies width blacklited companies (for ex., FDI stock, FDI flow, trade, number of companies width capital from blacklisted countries etc.).

The followidn steps planned to be taken:
*1) scraping data from regulations on the blacklisted countries beginning from 1995 (when Latvia started blacklisting countries which don't cooperate in tax matters) until these days;
*2) creating dataframes width all the blacklisted countries in all years (starting widh 1995);
*3) connecting data widh other publicly available data;
*4) analysing data.

The results are interesting as the program of blacklisting is still in place so this project could help to estimate the effect of this policy.
